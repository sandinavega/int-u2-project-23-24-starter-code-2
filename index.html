        <p>Cruelty to animals can be shown 
          in many different ways such as Physical signs, Psychological signs, and Enviromental signs. "Four Paws"
publishes a picture about identifiying animal cruelty.
Physical signs could be injuries, emaciation, 
and weakness. Psychological signs could be aggresions
to the animal, fear, and confusion. Enviromental 
signs could be lack of shelters, lack 
of food and water, and lack of sanitation. </p>

      <p>In my opinion I think that animal cruelty should stop because every animal deserves to have a good animal life, feel safe in the environment, and have food and water. Animal cruelty is a huge problem that has been going on for so long and is the reason why I'm here to speak up about it. </p>
